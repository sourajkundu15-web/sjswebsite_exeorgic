                <p><strong>Description:</strong>The Remote Control Car with RADAR is a compact reconnaissance vehicle built for remote surveillance and mapping; it is wirelessly controlled (ESP8266) and driven by DC motors through an L298N motor driver. A 180° servo-mounted sensor assembly acts as a RADAR-like scanner (ultrasonic) to sweep the surroundings while an onboard camera streams live video for real-time visualization and mapping. Ultrasonic sensing, along with buzzer and LED alerts, provides obstacle detection and local warnings; an LCD and potentiometer offer optional local display and control. Modular and portable, this platform combines robotics, sensing, and wireless connectivity to perform remote inspection, surveying, and situational awareness tasks (components: Arduino, ESP8266, L298N, DC motors, servo, ultrasonic sensor, camera, buzzer, LEDs, breadboard, LCD, potentiometer).</p>
